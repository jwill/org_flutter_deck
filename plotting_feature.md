### Research: Plotting in Flutter and Org Mode

#### Flutter Plotting Libraries

A web search for "flutter plotting libraries" and "flutter charting libraries" reveals several popular options:

*   **fl_chart:** This is one of the most popular and highly-rated charting libraries for Flutter. It supports a wide variety of charts, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots. It is well-documented, highly customizable, and actively maintained.
*   **graphic:** This library, developed by the Alibaba team, is based on the "Grammar of Graphics" concept, which provides a flexible and powerful way to build complex charts. It is very powerful but may have a steeper learning curve than `fl_chart`.
*   **syncfusion_flutter_charts:** A comprehensive suite of charting widgets from a well-known component vendor. It offers a very wide range of chart types and features but may be a heavier dependency than other options.

For this project, **`fl_chart`** appears to be the best choice. It is powerful enough to handle the likely plotting needs, has a straightforward API, and is widely used in the Flutter community.

#### Org Plot

The provided link to the Org Plot documentation reveals the following key details:

*   **Gnuplot Integration:** Org Plot's primary backend is `gnuplot`, a powerful command-line-driven graphing utility.
*   **Data Source:** The data for the plot is typically stored in an Org table directly within the document.
*   **Plot Generation:** Org Plot works by taking the data from the table and generating a `gnuplot` script. It then executes this script to create a plot image (e.g., a PNG file).
*   **Syntax:** The plotting is controlled by `#+PLOT:` keywords that specify the plot type, variables, and `gnuplot` options.

Here is a simple example from the documentation:

```org
#+PLOT: title:"Citas" ind:1 deps:(3) type:2d with:lines
| Sede      | Poblacion | Superficie | Citas |
|-----------+-----------+------------+-------|
| Barcelona |      1.62 |        101 |  1200 |
| Madrid    |      3.16 |        604 |  2500 |
| Paris     |      2.24 |        105 |  1800 |
```

When this is exported, Org Mode will generate a `gnuplot` script, run it, and insert a link to the resulting image file.

### Recommendation and Plan

I recommend adding plotting functionality by leveraging Org Plot's existing `gnuplot` integration and then rendering the resulting images in the Flutter presentation. This approach has several advantages:

*   It uses a well-defined and powerful feature of Org Mode.
*   It avoids the need to parse and interpret complex plotting commands in the Dart generation script.
*   It offloads the heavy lifting of plot generation to `gnuplot`, which is the standard tool for this in the Org Mode ecosystem.

Here is the proposed plan to implement this functionality:

1.  **Add `fl_chart` Dependency:** Add the `fl_chart` package to the `pubspec.yaml` file. This will be used for rendering the plots in the Flutter application.

2.  **Update Generation Script:** Modify the `tool/generate_from_org.dart` script to recognize and handle Org Plot syntax.
    *   **Detect `#+PLOT`:** The script will need to identify lines that start with `#+PLOT:`.
    *   **Locate Plot Data:** When a `#+PLOT` line is found, the script will need to find the associated Org table that contains the plot data.
    *   **Parse Plot Options:** The script will parse the `#+PLOT` line to extract key information, such as the plot title and type.
    *   **Generate `fl_chart` Code:** Instead of trying to run `gnuplot`, the script will convert the Org Plot data and options into the corresponding `fl_chart` widget code. For example, a `type:2d with:lines` plot would be translated into a `LineChart` widget.

3.  **Create a New Slide Type:** A new slide type will be created to host the generated charts. This will likely be a `FlutterDeckSlide.blank` with a `Column` containing the title and the `fl_chart` widget.

4.  **Update `README.md`:** The `README.md` file will be updated to document how to use the new plotting functionality, with examples of the supported Org Plot syntax.

This plan provides a clear path to adding powerful plotting capabilities to the presentation generator while staying true to the spirit of Org Mode's features.
